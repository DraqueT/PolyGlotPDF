I can't really describe what the logo looks like with just words. Not English words, anyhow. If only there were a tool to help me make some new ones...](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2750499/PolyGlot/readmeImages/PolyGlot%20Logo.png)\r\n### PolyGlot - Introduction\r\nPolyGlot is a tool that is designed to help in the design, creation, and publication of constructed languages, or conlangs. When I first got into language creation, I realized that there were no tools available that really met all of my needs. So I made one! Below, you'll find a list of its features, and if there's functionality you would like to see added, please feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues/new\">request a new feature!</a> PolyGlot is free and open source software that contains no advertising or other gross stuff. Please enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- A lexicon with advanced search, classification, and word creation capabilities\r\n- user definable orthography, with automatic  generation of word pronunciations\r\n- Support for lexicon imports from Excel sheets and CSV files\r\n- Formatted publishing to PDF, generating dictionaries (both conlang to natural language, and vice versa), chapter format for all grammar sections, gloss keys, orthographic rules, etc.\r\n- Support for importing and embedding custom fonts (useful for languages with nonstandard or custom character sets)\r\n- User definable parts of speech with integrated glossing system\r\n- User definable rules for declension/conjugation, which automatically generate all legal forms of words\r\n- Full logographic engine for languages that incorporate abstract symbols or entirely ideographic writing systems\r\n- Fully formatable grammar section, allowing language rules to be elegantly broken into chapters\r\n- Recording and playback of spoken examples within the grammar section\r\n- Interactive IPA chart with spoken examples and characters copied to clipboard (courtesy of http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/)\r\n- Language statistics window for analysis of current lexicon\r\n\r\n### Future Development\r\nI plan on continuing to develop and refine PolyGlot so long as there's a healthy conlanging community and people who seem to be enjoying the program. Please feel free to suggest changes/enhancements, request new features, or just drop me a line to show off what you've created with the tool! \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe author of this software can be reached at Draquemail@gmail.com.
